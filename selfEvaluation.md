# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?It has a lot of little details that will take a lot of practice but i think i get the overall idea.
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle? I had both kinds of struggle. It was confusing at times to know if we needed to implement past knowledge or do research for new knowledge.
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that? I plan to keep utilizing my small group and schedule in a few hours a day between now and mod 1.
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need? I will use my group, the office hours, and my own research to figure it out!
